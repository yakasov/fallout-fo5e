# Character Creation Summary

Each character has one background, one race, a mix of SPECIAL points and one (or two, depending on the GM) trait(s).


## Backgrounds


## Races


## SPECIAL

Unlike normal Fallout, these instead range from -5 to 5. You begin character creation allocating ten points into your key SPECIAL stats. 

**The cost of allocating a point is equal to the level the stat is advancing to** - for example, increase STR from level 2 to 3 will cost 3 SPECIAL points.

**You can also deallocate points, which will refund you - and you can bring any stat below 0. Doing so will give you 1 SPECIAL point back per level dropped.** For example, decreasing INT from level 3 to 2 will give you your 3 SPECIAL points back, whereas decreasing INT from level -3 to -4 will give you 1 point extra.
