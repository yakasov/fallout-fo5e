# Character Creation Summary

Each character has one background, one race, a mix of SPECIAL points and one (or two, depending on the GM) trait(s).


## Backgrounds


## Races

When creating a character, you have a choice of five races: Humans, Ghouls, Synths, Super Mutants and Nightkin. Each race has specific stat changes - however, Humans have less changes to allow for a more blank slate. Depending on the GM and the player, you could also allow Deathclaws and Dogs Ã  la Fallout Tactics.

## SPECIAL

Unlike normal Fallout, these instead range from -5 to 5. You begin character creation allocating ten points into your key SPECIAL stats. 

**The cost of allocating a point is equal to the level the stat is advancing to** - for example, increase STR from level 2 to 3 will cost 3 SPECIAL points.

**You can also deallocate points, which will refund you - and you can bring any stat below 0. Doing so will give you 1 SPECIAL point back per level dropped.** For example, decreasing INT from level 3 to 2 will give you your 3 SPECIAL points back, whereas decreasing INT from level -3 to -4 will give you 1 point extra.

## Traits

Traits tend to modify different aspects of gameplay, such as SPECIAL stats, derived stats and skills. Most traits will have positive and negative results to create more interesting characters. Each character may choose one (or two, depending on the GM) trait(s), but you can also choose to take no trait at all.
