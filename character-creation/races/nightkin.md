# Nightkin

## General Information

### Description

Nightkin are also the result of the Forced Evolutionary Virus (see Super Mutants for more information). They are considered the apex of the Master's creations, the best of his mutant army.

Nightkin share nearly all their characteristics with super mutants - but are considered improvements in nearly every way. They possess higher levels of strength, resiliency and intelligence than their green brothers.

However, the nightkin have been altered further by prolonged use of Stealth Boy technology, which is the cause for their gray-blue colouration. This Stealth Boy addiction also resulted in mental instability and disorders, leading to schizoprenia, delusions and even split personalities in many nightkin.

Since the downfall of the Master's army in 2161, the nightkin have wandered the wasteland. Because of their aversion to being seen and their overall mental damage, they often live in groups away from civilisation.
