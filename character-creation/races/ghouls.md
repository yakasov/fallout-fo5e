# Ghouls

## General Information

### Description

Ghouls are mutated humans (or, in some cases, animals) affected by 'ghoulification'. In the majority of cases, ghouls are feral and do not retain memories of their previous human life, but in some cases ghouls can otherwise keep their mental faculties intact. 

In terms of appearance, their skin will appear rough and boiled, and loss of tissue similar to leprosy resulting in exposed blood vessels, muscles and sometimes even bones.

Ghouls often lose their hair, and have deteriorated vocal cords, resulting in a raspy voice. The ghoulification can also often lead to degenerative conditions like necrosis, rot, arthritis and more - although these may be less present in non-feral ghouls.

Despite their appearance, their flesh is not actually rotten - instead, it is just affected by prolonged radiation. Ghouls are infertile, but have greatly extended lifespans and are immune to (and in a lot of cases healed by) radiation of any kind.

Ghouls, unlike what a certain ghoul in a fridge might tell you, do still require food and water to survive. However, due to their changes, they can eat nearly anything due to their hardened gut and lack of smell.

Ghouls are immune to most common diseases, excluding diseases that can affect the mind. However, drugs will also have a diminished effect on their physiology, and so will need higher doses or stronger drugs to achieve similar effects to humans.
