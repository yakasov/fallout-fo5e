# Super Mutants

## General Information

### Description

*Note: due to the stat effects of super mutants, they may be considered a more specialised race - so they may not have a large choice in class.*

Super mutants are a result of the Forced Evolutionary Virus - humans dipped into vats filled with the virus often resulted in powerful super soldiers, large in size and potentially much more intelligent.

Typically, super mutants will exhibit exceptional strength and increased resistance or even immunity to diseases and radiation - however, their intelligence may not always be increased, and can sometimes actually be hindered.

Super mutants belong to different generations depending on who they were made by - newer generations tend to have worse intelligence, but may be stronger and generally larger in size. Earlier generation super mutants tend to be leaders of armies with later generation super mutants for this reason.

First generation super mutants have paler, olive skin in addition to larger muscles and somewhat cracked skin. Second generation super mutants have greener, smoother skin, which may vary in brightness (although they will not be glowing green, unlike Glowing Ones).

Super mutants are infertile and cannot reproduce, but also do not age. Due to this, they have no children, and without a process to make more (often against the will of the human involved) their numbers will dwindle over the years.

### Interactions

Humans tend to run in fear at the mere sight of a super mutant - although friendly super mutants aren't unheard of. Depending on the community, you may be shunned or discriminated against. Ghouls, on the other hand, may find no trouble with you if you present no threat to them. Super mutants and nightkin can co-habit together.
