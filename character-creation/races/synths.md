# Synths

## General Information

### Description

Synths are the robotic and biomechanical beings created by the Institute. While Generation 1 and 2 synths are entirely mechanical, Generation 3 synths are bio-organic constructs that are near-indistinguishable from humans.

Despite what the Institute says, Generation 3 synths often display signs of sentience and attempt to escape the Institute to live their own lives. While most wastelanders view synths with suspicion and paranoia, select groups are sympathetic to the sentient cause, comparing their treatment by the Institute to slavery.

It's not known when synths were first manufactured, but by 2227, the first third generation synths were being created. These synths are the pinnacle of synth technology, being almost indistinguishable from humans right down to the cellular level. They are created and assembled in labs with grown bones, muscles and other tissues to resemble a real human being.

Synths are different to humans in several ways, however. Aside from being androids, they also contain neurological implants allowing them to be programmed and to be manipulated via voice commands. This implant cannot be removed without killing the synth.

Additionally, synths do not consider themselves human. They do not require sleep (although can still choose to), and do not need to eat nor fear disease. This does not mean they do not want to eat, however, as many synths seem to have an affinity for certain foods (Fancy Lads Snack Cakes, for example).

### Age

20 - 60 <br>
Synths do not age, but mimic humans when they are created. Their age is set once and does not change.

### Interactions

Many denizens of the wasteland are paranoid and prejudiced against synths, fearing they or someone they know may be abducted and replaced with a synth without them knowing. Because of this, humans and civilized communities tend to be more hostile towards them (especially the Brotherhood of Steel) - although this is not without exception.

The Institute creators of these synths view them as nothing more as machines, and treat them as slaves. To this end, The Railroad commit themselves to freeing Generation 3 synths from their masters and smuggling them to safer places.
