# Humans

## General Information

### Description

Once the Great War began, humanity and civilization as a whole was impacted painfully and severely. Survivors began to fight each other for resource and raid for supplies, with radiation causing widespread disease and illness.

Those who lived outside major cities or who managed to escape them as the war began faced a much better chance of survival. Survivors either found safety in underground vaults, in relatively unaffected areas in the wasteland or, in one case, Las Vegas.

Some of the less fortunate survivors on the surface (and the inhabitants of Vault 12) were exposed to radioactive fallout and thermal radiation, resulting in them becoming ghouls.

Despite the widespread radiation and resulting mutations, humans still reign dominant in the wasteland. Humans with minor mutations like extra toes or permanent red eyes are considered still human.

Due to the general lack of extreme mutation, humans are very similar to humans nowadays. However, there are some groups in the wasteland that distinguish harshly between 'pure humans' and 'normal humans' - where pure humans are nearly always from vaults, where they have not been affected by radiation or post-War pollutants.
