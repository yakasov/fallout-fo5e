# Mechanics

This will go over mechanics unique or different in FO5E. Other mechanics, such as Armour Class, will not have explanations but will still list their related formula.

## Action Points

Action Points determine how many actions you can take per turn. Moving, using an item from your inventory (but not accessing it), attacking or making a standard action will use AP. You can keep taking your turn until you choose to end your turn or you run out of AP.  
*Formula: = [8 + (AGI x 2)] (≥ 5)*

## Armour Class

*Formula: = [12 + AGI]*

## Carry Weight

In FO5E, there is no penalty to having your inventory weigh as much as your max carry weight - but as soon as you become over-encumbered, you cannot move until the weight has been reduced.  
*Formula: = [130 + (STR x 20)] lbs*

## Critical Chance

Every turn, unless a nat 1 or 20 was rolled, a critical die (d100) can be rolled to determine whether the attack does critical damage. The attack must hit for this die to be rolled. If the roll is greater than or equal to your Critical Chance, then you deal a critical hit!  
*Formula: = [5 + LCK] (≥ 1)%*

## Experience Points

*Formula: = XP + [5 x INT]%*

## Healing Rate

Healing Rate determines how many Hit Points you naturally restore. Every day you naturally heal your Healing Rate, whereas whilst resting you can heal more.  
*Formula: = [2 + (END / 2)] (≥ 1)*  
*Per day: = 1d[HR x 4]*  
*Short rest: = 1d[HR x 8] + 4*  
*Long rest: = 1d[HR x 12] + 4*

## Hit Points

*Formula:*  
*Initial: = [10 + STR + (END x 2)] (≥ 8)*  
*Per level: = [5 + (END / 2)]*

## Initiative

*Formula: = [1d20 + PER]*

## Melee Damage

*Formula: = 1d[4 + STR] (≥ 1)*

## Overall Dice Bonus

On each roll, if your Luck is positive, you must also roll an additional die to add to your overall roll. If your Luck is negative, then roll a normal die for that Luck value, and subtract it from your overall roll.  
*Formula: = 1d[LCK]*

## Random Encounters

.

## Resistances

There are two resistances: poison and radiation. When you are hit by an attack that inflicts these status effects (or happen to be in a radioactive area), your chance to be affected is decreased by your resistance. If you are affected, the damage taken is reduced by your resistance.  
*Formula: = [25 + (END x 5)]%*

## Skill Points
